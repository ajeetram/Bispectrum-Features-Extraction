# Bispectrum-Features-Extraction
- The EEG signal is a time domain signal and the signal
Energy distribution is scattered. In order to extract the
bispectrum features, the EEG signal is analyzed to give a
description of the signal energy as a function of time and
frequency. The features extracted in the frequency domain
by using Bispectrum analysis that can recognize the mental
emotion based on EEG signals.

- This project attempted to classify the emotions (sad,neutral and
happy) based on EEG signals using various machine learning
algorithm like SVM,random forest, knn, or logistic
regression,naive bayes.It passes through total four
phases.The first phase is to extract the data from the EEG
signal followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA,LDA
,then classification using any of the above mentioned
techniques and finally evaluating the classifier
performance.As a result Random forest using LDA achieved
better performance than all the classifiers.
